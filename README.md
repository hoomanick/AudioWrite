## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
*   **Your own Google Gemini API Key.** You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Running Locally (after cloning)

If you want to run a local copy *after cloning the repository*:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hoomanick/AudioWrite.git
    cd AudioWrite
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will usually open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or a similar port).

4.  **Set Your API Key:**
    *   Click the **Settings icon** (🔑) in the app.
    *   Enter your Gemini API Key and click "Save & Apply Key".
    *   **This key is required for all AI features.** It's stored in `sessionStorage` (cleared when you close the browser tab/window).

## 📖 How to Use

1.  **Set API Key:** If not already done, provide your Gemini API Key via Settings (🔑).
2.  **Record:** Click the microphone button (🎙️). Grant microphone permission if prompted.
3.  **Speak:** Dictate your content.
4.  **Stop:** Click the stop button (⏹️).
5.  **Review & Edit:**
    *   The **Polished Note** is shown by default. Use the "Copy Polished" button to copy its content.
    *   Switch to **Raw Transcription** using the tabs. Use the "Copy Raw" button for its content.
    *   Edit the note title, raw transcription, or polished content directly. Changes save automatically.
6.  **Customize (Optional):**
    *   **Output Language:** Select your desired language for the polished note.
    *   **Custom Prompt (✨):** Provide specific instructions to the AI for note polishing (e.g., "Summarize in 3 bullet points," "Adopt a formal tone").
7.  **Manage Notes:**
    *   **New Note (📄):** Creates a blank note.
    *   **Archive (🗄️):** View, load, re-polish, or delete saved notes.
    *   **Theme (☀️/🌙):** Toggle light/dark mode.

## 🌍 PWA (Progressive Web App)

*   **Installable:** On supported devices, install AudioWrite for an app-like experience.
*   **Offline Access:** The app shell and previously saved notes (from local storage) are accessible offline. Core app assets are cached by the service worker generated by `vite-plugin-pwa`.
*   *Note: AI features require an active internet connection and a valid API key for the session.*

## 🚀 Deployment

AudioWrite is built using Vite and deployed as a static website to GitHub Pages.

### GitHub Pages Deployment Steps (Summary):

1.  Push your code to your GitHub repository (`main` branch for source).
2.  Ensure `vite.config.ts` has the correct `base` path (e.g., `/AudioWrite/`).
3.  Ensure `package.json` has the correct `homepage` URL.
4.  Run `npm run deploy`. This script builds the project and pushes the `dist` folder contents to the `gh-pages` branch.
5.  Configure GitHub Pages (Settings > Pages) to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch.
6.  Your site will be available at `https://hoomanick.github.io/AudioWrite/`.
7.  *Users of the deployed version will need to provide their own Gemini API Key.*
